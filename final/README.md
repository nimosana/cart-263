# 9 Circles
## Nicolas Morales-Sanabria

Using ArrowKeys/WASD to move, and spacebar to defend themselves when needed, the player must go through a cycle of death to discover what awaits them further.

Spoiler:
The player goes through 7 levels/circles of hell based on the Divine comedy by Dante. The Player starts in Limbo, where they are inevitably lapidated and go to the next circle. The player proceeds in the same manner until they get to the 7th circle, where they ultimately appear to be stuck, stuck in violence.
